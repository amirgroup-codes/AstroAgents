        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of dibenzo thiophene (ID 14) and 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27) exclusively in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur-containing aromatics may be diagnostic markers for abiotic synthesis in meteorites, potentially formed through gas-phase reactions in the solar nebula or on parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzo thiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311; notably absent in all soil samples"

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of naphthalene (ID 1) and its methylated derivatives (IDs 2, 8, 15) primarily in meteorites, with decreasing abundance as methylation increases, suggests a systematic abiotic synthesis pathway that preferentially forms simpler PAHs over their methylated counterparts in space.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 1 (naphthalene) present in 9 samples; ID 2/8 (methylnaphthalenes) in 7 samples; ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) in only 3 meteorite samples"

            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of 1H-Phenalen-1-one/9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44) exclusively in Orgueil and LEW 85311 meteorites suggests that oxygen-containing PAHs may form through specific oxidation pathways in certain parent bodies, potentially indicating different formation conditions or alteration histories.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 44 found only in Orgueil and LEW 85311; contrasts with non-oxygenated PAHs like fluoranthene (ID 12) and pyrene (ID 13) found in multiple meteorites"

            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The exclusive presence of indane (ID 11) and its methylated derivative (ID 23) in Antarctic meteorites suggests these compounds may be formed through specific low-temperature chemical processes, possibly during the meteorites' residence in Antarctic ice.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 11 (indane) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 23 (methylindan) in ALH 83100, LON 94101; absence in non-Antarctic meteorites and all soil samples"
