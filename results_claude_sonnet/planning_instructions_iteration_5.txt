{
    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on analyzing PAH distribution patterns and methylation in meteorite samples. Specifically examine: naphthalene (ID 1), 2-methyl naphthalene (ID 2), 1-methyl naphthalene (ID 8), trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15), fluoranthene (ID 12), pyrene (ID 13), phenanthrene/anthracene (ID 42), biphenyl (ID 43), and dimethylpyrene (ID 45). Generate hypotheses about formation conditions based on methylation patterns and PAH distributions across different meteorite samples.",
    
    "Agent2_instructions": "Investigate organosulfur compounds and their relationships with other molecular species in meteorite samples. Focus on: dibenzo thiophene (ID 14), 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27), and their co-occurrence with other compounds. Compare distribution patterns between different meteorite samples (Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, etc.) and develop hypotheses about formation mechanisms.",
    
    "Agent3_instructions": "Analyze the unique molecular signatures in biotic samples, focusing on: possible terpenes (IDs 4, 17, 18), ergost-14-ene (ID 28), and unknown compounds specific to soil samples (IDs 10, 16, 19, 38-41). Generate hypotheses about how these molecular patterns differ from meteoritic organic matter and what they reveal about biological processes in different environments."
