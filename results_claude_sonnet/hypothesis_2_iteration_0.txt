            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of dibenzothiophene (ID 14) and 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27) exclusively in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur incorporation into aromatic structures occurred through abiotic processes in the early solar system rather than through biological pathways.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) found in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) found in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311; notably absent in all soil samples"

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of fluoranthene (ID 12) and pyrene (ID 13) primarily in CM and CI meteorites, but not in soil samples, indicates these 4-ring PAHs were synthesized through specific high-temperature abiotic processes in the solar nebula rather than through biological processes or contamination.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (fluoranthene) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 (pyrene) in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311; absence in all soil samples"

            "statement": "The presence of oxygen-containing aromatics like 1H-Phenalen-1-one (ID 44) exclusively in meteorites suggests that oxygen incorporation into PAH structures occurred through specific abiotic oxidation pathways in the early solar system, distinct from biological oxidation processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 44 (1H-Phenalen-1-one) found only in Orgueil and LEW 85311; absence in all soil samples including organics-rich Green River Shale and Lignite Soil"

            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The distribution pattern of methylated naphthalenes (IDs 2, 8, 15, 37) suggests a systematic abiotic methylation process in meteorites that differs from biological methylation, as evidenced by their presence primarily in meteorites and absence in biologically active soils.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2 (2-methylnaphthalene), ID 8 (1-methylnaphthalene), ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene), ID 37 (dimethylnaphthalene) found predominantly in meteorite samples"
