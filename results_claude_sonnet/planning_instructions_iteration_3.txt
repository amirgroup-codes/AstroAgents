{
    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on analyzing PAH distribution patterns in meteorites. Specifically examine compounds with IDs 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 42, 43, 45. Compare the presence of basic PAHs (naphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene) versus their methylated derivatives across different meteorite samples. Develop hypotheses about formation conditions based on these PAH distributions.",
    
    "Agent2_instructions": "Investigate sulfur-containing organic compounds and their relationships with other molecular species. Analyze compounds with IDs 14, 27, 32, 33, 36, 37. Pay special attention to the co-occurrence of dibenzothiophene, trithiolane, and related compounds in meteorite samples. Develop hypotheses about sulfur incorporation mechanisms in extraterrestrial organic synthesis.",
    
    "Agent3_instructions": "Study the distribution patterns of organic compounds in extreme environment soils (Antarctica, Atacama, Rio Tinto). Focus on compounds with IDs 4, 5, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 38, 39, 40, 41. Compare molecular distributions between different soil environments and develop hypotheses about preservation mechanisms in extreme conditions."
