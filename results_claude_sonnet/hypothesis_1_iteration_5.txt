            "statement": "The presence of methylated naphthalenes (IDs 2, 8, 15) in meteorites but not in soil samples suggests that abiotic methylation of PAHs occurs through distinct chemical pathways in space that are not prevalent in Earth's biotic systems. This indicates a potential chemical marker for distinguishing abiotic from biotic origins of PAHs.",
            "key_datapoints": "IDs 2 (2-Methyl naphthalene), 8 (1-Methyl naphthalene), and 15 (Trimethyl naphthalene) found in Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, and other meteorites but absent in soil samples"

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of sulfur-containing aromatics (IDs 14, 27) exclusively in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur incorporation into aromatic structures may be a distinctive feature of abiotic chemical synthesis in space, potentially serving as a marker for extraterrestrial organic chemistry.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (Dibenzo thiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-Trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311"

            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (Fluoranthene) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 (Pyrene) in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311"
