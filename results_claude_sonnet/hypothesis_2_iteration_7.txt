        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of methylated PAHs (e.g., methylnaphthalenes) predominantly in meteorite samples but not in soil samples suggests that abiotic methylation of PAHs occurs through cosmic ray or UV-induced radical chemistry in space rather than through biological processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2,8 (2- and 1-methylnaphthalene) found in meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, LEW 85311 but absent in most soil samples; ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) in Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311; ID 37 (dimethylnaphthalene) in Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of organosulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) specifically in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur incorporation into organic compounds was an important abiotic process in the early solar system, possibly catalyzed by metal sulfides present in the meteorite parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311; notably absent in all soil samples"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of fluoranthene and pyrene exclusively in meteorite samples, coupled with their specific isomer distribution (both found in LON 94101, LEW 85311), indicates these 4-ring PAHs formed through specific high-temperature gas-phase reactions in the solar nebula rather than through biological processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (fluoranthene) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 (pyrene) in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311; absence in all soil samples including organic-rich ones"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The exclusive presence of indane and its methylated derivative in CM2 meteorites suggests a specific abiotic synthesis pathway involving cyclopentane ring formation and subsequent aromatization, which may be unique to meteoritic parent body processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 11 (indane) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 23 (methylindan) in ALH 83100, LON 94101; notably absent in all soil samples and other meteorite types"
