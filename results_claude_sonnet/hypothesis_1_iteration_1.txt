        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of methylated PAHs (e.g., methylnaphthalenes) predominantly in meteorite samples but not in soil samples suggests that abiotic methylation of PAHs occurs through distinct chemical pathways in space that are not common in terrestrial environments.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2 (2-methylnaphthalene), ID 8 (1-methylnaphthalene), ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) found mainly in meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, and LEW 85311, but absent in soil samples"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of organosulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) specifically in meteorites suggests that sulfur incorporation into aromatic structures was an important abiotic process in the early solar system, possibly catalyzed by mineral surfaces under reducing conditions.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil/ALH 83100/LEW 85311, ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas/LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The exclusive presence of high molecular weight PAHs (fluoranthene, pyrene, dimethylpyrene) in meteorites but not soils indicates that extended PAH structures preferentially formed and survived in space environments, possibly through stepwise molecular growth via acetylene additions under cosmic ray exposure.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (fluoranthene), ID 13 (pyrene), ID 45 (dimethylpyrene) found only in meteorites like Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The detection of ergostene exclusively in soil samples suggests it serves as a reliable biomarker for distinguishing biotic from abiotic organic matter, as its complex structure likely requires enzymatic biosynthesis rather than abiotic processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 28 (ergost-14-ene) found only in Lignite Soil and Murchison Soil samples"
