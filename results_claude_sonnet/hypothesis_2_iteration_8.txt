        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27) exclusively in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 meteorites, coupled with dibenzothiophene (ID 14) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311, suggests that sulfur-containing aromatics may serve as diagnostic markers for distinguishing between different degrees of aqueous alteration in carbonaceous chondrites. This is supported by the fact that these compounds are absent in highly processed meteorites and terrestrial samples.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311; ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311"

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of naphthalene (ID 1) and its methylated derivatives (IDs 2, 8, 15) primarily in meteoritic samples, with decreasing abundance of higher methylated homologs, indicates a non-biological formation pathway. This contrasts with biological PAH methylation patterns seen in the Green River Shale and Lignite soil samples, where methylated derivatives show more random distribution patterns.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 1 (naphthalene), ID 2 (2-methyl naphthalene), ID 8 (1-methyl naphthalene), ID 15 (trimethyl naphthalene) distribution patterns in meteorites vs. soil samples"

        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of both fluoranthene (ID 12) and pyrene (ID 13) exclusively in meteoritic samples (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, Orgueil) but not in any terrestrial samples suggests these specific 4-ring PAHs formed through high-temperature gas-phase reactions in the solar nebula rather than through biological processes or thermal alteration of biological material.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (fluoranthene) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 (pyrene) in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311; absence in all soil samples"

            "statement": "The exclusive detection of indane (ID 11) and methylindan (ID 23) in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311) but not in non-Antarctic meteorites or terrestrial samples suggests these compounds may form through specific low-temperature chemical processes during long-term exposure to Antarctic conditions, rather than being indigenous to the meteorites.",
