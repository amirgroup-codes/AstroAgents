        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of dibenzo thiophene (ID 14) and 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27) exclusively in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur-containing aromatics may be diagnostic markers for abiotic synthesis in meteorites, potentially formed through the incorporation of sulfur during early solar system processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 found in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 found in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311; notably absent in all soil samples"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two", 
            "statement": "The co-occurrence pattern of naphthalene (ID 1) and its methylated derivatives (IDs 2, 8, 15) suggests a systematic alkylation pathway in meteorites, where the degree of methylation decreases with molecular weight, potentially indicating a specific abiotic synthesis mechanism distinct from biological processes.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 1 (naphthalene) present in most meteorites; ID 2/8 (methylnaphthalenes) in fewer meteorites; ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) in only three meteorites (Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311)"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The exclusive presence of fluoranthene (ID 12) and pyrene (ID 13) in Antarctic meteorites and Orgueil, coupled with their absence in soil samples, suggests these 4-ring PAHs may be preserved markers of primordial organic synthesis, protected by the cold Antarctic environment from terrestrial contamination and degradation.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 found in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311; absent in all soil samples including Antarctic soil"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The presence of phenanthrene/anthracene (ID 42) and 1H-Phenalen-1-one/9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44) exclusively in Orgueil and LEW 85311 suggests a unique oxidative pathway in these meteorites that converts PAHs to their oxygenated derivatives, potentially indicating distinct parent body processing conditions.",
            "key_datapoints": "IDs 42 and 44 found only in Orgueil and LEW 85311; related to oxidation of PAH structures"
