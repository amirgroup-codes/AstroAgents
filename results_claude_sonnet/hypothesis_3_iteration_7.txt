            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of methylated PAHs (e.g., methylnaphthalenes, trimethylnaphthalenes) predominantly in meteorite samples but not in soil samples suggests that alkylation of PAHs occurs through abiotic processes in space rather than through biological activity.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2,8 (methylnaphthalenes) found in meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison; ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) in Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311; notably absent in soil samples"

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of organosulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) specifically in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur incorporation into organic compounds was an important abiotic process in the early solar system, possibly catalyzed by metal sulfides present in the meteorite parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311"

        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The exclusive presence of high molecular weight PAHs (fluoranthene, pyrene) in meteorites but not in soil samples indicates that these compounds form through high-temperature gas-phase reactions in space rather than through biological processes or thermal alteration on Earth.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 12 (fluoranthene) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 13 (pyrene) in Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311"

            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The presence of partially hydrogenated aromatic compounds (indane, acenaphthene, tetrahydrophenanthrene) specifically in meteorites suggests a stepwise PAH formation process in space involving both aromatic ring formation and partial hydrogenation steps.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 11 (indane) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; ID 33 (acenaphthene) in ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 36 (tetrahydrophenanthrene) in Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan"
