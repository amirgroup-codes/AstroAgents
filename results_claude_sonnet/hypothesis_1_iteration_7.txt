            "statement": "The presence of methylated PAHs (e.g., methylnaphthalenes, trimethylnaphthalene) predominantly in meteorite samples but not in soil samples suggests that alkylation of PAHs occurs through abiotic processes in space rather than through biological activity.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2 (2-methylnaphthalene), ID 8 (1-methylnaphthalene), ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) found mainly in meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, LEW 85311"

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of organosulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) exclusively in meteorite samples suggests a unique sulfur-based chemistry in the early solar system that is distinct from biological sulfur incorporation pathways.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311"

            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of high molecular weight PAHs (fluoranthene, pyrene) exclusively in meteorites but not in soil samples indicates that these compounds form through high-temperature abiotic processes in space rather than biological processes.",
