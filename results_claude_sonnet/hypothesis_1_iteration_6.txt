            "statement": "The presence of methylated PAHs (e.g., methylnaphthalenes, trimethylnaphthalenes) predominantly in meteorite samples but not in soil samples suggests that alkylation of PAHs occurs through abiotic processes in space rather than through biological activity.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 2 (2-methylnaphthalene), ID 8 (1-methylnaphthalene), ID 15 (trimethylnaphthalene) found mainly in meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, LEW 85311"

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of organosulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) specifically in meteorite samples suggests that sulfur incorporation into organic compounds was an important abiotic process in the early solar system, possibly catalyzed by metal sulfides present in the meteorite parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 14 (dibenzothiophene) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LEW 85311; ID 27 (1,2,4-trithiolane) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311"
