{
    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on analyzing PAH distribution patterns and their methylated derivatives in meteorites vs terrestrial samples. Specifically examine: naphthalene (ID 1), 2-methyl naphthalene (ID 2), 1-methyl naphthalene (ID 8), trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15), fluoranthene (ID 12), pyrene (ID 13), phenanthrene/anthracene (ID 42), biphenyl (ID 43), and dimethylpyrene (ID 45). Compare their occurrence patterns between meteoritic and terrestrial samples to develop hypotheses about their formation mechanisms.",
    
    "Agent2_instructions": "Investigate sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds across sample types. Analyze the distribution of: dibenzo thiophene (ID 14), 1,2,4-trithiolane (ID 27), and their relationships with other organic compounds. Compare their presence/absence patterns between meteoritic and terrestrial samples, focusing on potential formation pathways in different environments.",
    
    "Agent3_instructions": "Study partially reduced and alkylated compounds: toluene (ID 7), indane (ID 11), methylindan (ID 23), dimethyl cyclohexane (ID 25), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (ID 36), tetramethylindene (ID 20), and polysubstituted alkylnaphthalenes (IDs 32, 35, 37). Analyze their distribution patterns to understand reduction processes in different environments."
