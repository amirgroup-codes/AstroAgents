{
    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on analyzing PAH distribution patterns in meteorites. Specifically examine compounds with IDs 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 42, 43, 45. Develop hypotheses about the relationship between parent PAHs (naphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene, phenanthrene, biphenyl) and their methylated derivatives across different meteorite samples. Consider how these distributions might reflect formation conditions in the early solar system.",
    
    "Agent2_instructions": "Investigate organosulfur compounds and their relationships in meteoritic samples. Analyze compounds with IDs 14, 27, and related molecular structures. Examine the co-occurrence patterns of 1,2,4-trithiolane and dibenzothiophene specifically in meteorites like Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311. Develop hypotheses about their abiotic formation pathways and significance in early solar system chemistry.",
    
    "Agent3_instructions": "Study the distribution of complex cyclic and aromatic compounds in both meteoritic and soil samples. Focus on compounds with IDs 11, 23, 25, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 44. Compare the occurrence patterns of indane, acenaphthene, alkylnaphthalenes, and phenalene derivatives. Develop hypotheses about the different formation pathways of these compounds in abiotic versus biotic contexts."
