ðŸ“Š Data Analyzer Output:
Based on the data and sample descriptions provided, I'll analyze key patterns and develop specific hypotheses, focusing particularly on PAH distributions and potential contamination markers.

Key Observations and Patterns:

1. PAH Distribution Patterns:
- Unsubstituted PAHs (naphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene) are predominantly found in meteorite samples
- Alkylated PAHs (methyl naphthalenes, trimethyl naphthalene) show more selective distribution
- The CM2 meteorites (Murchison, ALH 83100, etc.) share similar PAH profiles but with subtle variations

2. Contamination Indicators:
- Phthalates (IDs 9, 24) appear exclusively in soil samples and newer meteorite finds
- Dichlorobenzene (ID 29) is only found in Orgueil and Murchison
- Several compounds marked as "internal contaminants" (IDs 3, 6, 21, 22) appear across both meteorite and soil samples

3. Unique Molecular Patterns:
- Sulfur-containing compounds (dibenzothiophene, trithiolane) appear predominantly in meteorite samples
- Terpene-like compounds (IDs 4, 17, 18) are exclusively found in soil samples
- Complex alkylated aromatics show distinct distribution between meteoritic and soil samples

Specific Novel Hypotheses:

1. "The Selective Alkylation Hypothesis":
The presence of specific alkylated PAHs (like trimethyl naphthalene) in only certain meteorites (Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311) suggests these compounds formed through distinct abiotic processes rather than terrestrial contamination. This can be tested by:
- Comparing alkylation patterns between meteorites and terrestrial samples
- Analyzing position-specific isotope ratios in alkylated PAHs
- Studying alkylation patterns in experimental abiotic synthesis

2. "The Sulfur-Coupling Mechanism Hypothesis":
The co-occurrence of sulfur-containing aromatics (dibenzothiophene) with specific PAHs in meteorites suggests a linked formation mechanism involving sulfur incorporation during PAH synthesis. This could be tested by:
- Analyzing correlation patterns between sulfur-aromatics and PAHs
- Conducting sulfur isotope analysis of these compounds
- Performing laboratory synthesis experiments under relevant conditions

3. "The Preservation Gradient Hypothesis":
The varying distribution of high molecular weight PAHs (fluoranthene, pyrene) versus low molecular weight PAHs (naphthalene) across meteorite samples reflects different degrees of thermal processing and preservation rather than initial formation conditions. This can be tested by:
- Comparing PAH ratios with other thermal alteration indicators
- Analyzing spatial distribution of PAHs within individual meteorites
- Conducting experimental thermal alteration studies

These hypotheses are specific, testable, and grounded in the observed data patterns while avoiding overly general statements about prebiotic chemistry.
