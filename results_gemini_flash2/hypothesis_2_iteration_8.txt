            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8), 1-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10), Indane (C9H10), Fluoranthene (C16H10), Pyrene (C16H10), and Dibenzo thiophene (C12H8S) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 suggests a common origin and similar formation environment or parent body for these meteorites, despite their classification into different chemical groups (CI1, CM2). This is contingent on these compounds being verified as indigenous and not terrestrial contaminants.",

The presence of these compounds in the meteorite samples may suggest terrestrial contamination.",
            "key_datapoints": "Polysubstituted alkylbenzene (ID 5), C7H10 (ID 17), C5H8 (ID 18), Iceland Soil, Atacama, GSFC soil Soil."

            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of specific internal GC column contaminants (IDs 3, 6, 21, 22) across both biotic and abiotic samples indicates that the extraction and analysis methods, while consistent, introduce a background signal that must be carefully considered when interpreting low-abundance features. These should be excluded from biosignature analysis.",

        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The detection of phthalates (ID 9 and 24), likely environmental contaminants, across diverse sample types (soils and meteorites) points to the ubiquitous nature of these compounds in laboratory environments and highlights the challenges in discerning indigenous from exogenous organic material. Further, the absence of phthalates in some samples suggests that the protocol is not universally contaminated.",
            "key_datapoints": "Phthalates (IDs 9 and 24), Orgueil, Rio Tinto Soil, GSFC soil Soil, Murchison Soil, Aguas Zarcas, Jbilet Winselwan."

            "statement": "The detection of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27; C2H4S3) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests the presence of organosulfur compounds in these meteorites. The absence of this compound in the rest of the meteorite samples may reflect differences in parent body processes or aqueous alteration. This hypothesis is based on the published literature.",

            "statement": "The presence of Dichlorobenzene (ID 29; C6H4Cl2) in the Murchison and Orgueil meteorites could point to a specific chlorination process occurring in the parent bodies of these meteorites, or a shared terrestrial contamination source specific to these samples. Follow-up analyses and careful controls are needed to determine the origin of this compound.",

This is based on the presence of Methylindan (ID 23; C10H12), Fluorene/diphenylene methane (C13H10) (ID 32), and Acenaphthene (ID 33; C12H10).",
