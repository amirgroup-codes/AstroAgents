        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of specific PAHs is more indicative of source than aqueous alteration, as fluoranthene and pyrene are the most abundant PAHs in most meteorites, regardless of alteration level. The size and presence of these PAHs indicate that these molecules are either primordial or result from similar formation mechanisms across different parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "Fluoranthene, Pyrene, Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The detection of low-mass PAHs (e.g., Naphthalene) and alkylated derivatives in the Orgueil meteorite, despite its high degree of aqueous alteration, suggests that either these compounds were recently formed on the parent body (potentially through aqueous alteration of organic macromolecules) or that terrestrial contamination is more prevalent in this meteorite despite the cleaning process.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene, 2-Methyl naphthalene, 1-Methyl naphthalene, Orgueil"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The prevalence of the internal GC column contaminants indicates that terrestrial contamination, despite efforts to minimize it, may still significantly affect the detection of extraterrestrial organic matter, especially when the abundance of indigenous molecules is low. The presence of the same contaminants in meteorites and soils suggests a common source, likely the laboratory environment.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 3, 6, 21, 22, Iceland Soil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Jbilet Winselwan, EET 96029, Utah soil Soil, GSFC soil Soil, Murchison Soil, Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil, Murchison"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The detection of potential terrestrial contaminants, such as diethyl phthalate (or other phthalates), o-Cymene, and dichlorobenzene, in specific meteorites/soils while being absent from others processed using identical methods can indicate the heterogeneity of the samples and may compromise the data interpretation.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 9, 24, 29, 30, Rio Tinto Soil, GSFC soil Soil, Murchison Soil, Orgueil, Murchison, Aguas Zarcas, Jbilet Winselwan"

        {
            "id": "H_five",
            "statement": "The presence of unknown compounds with mass-to-charge ratios of 123.0, 154.0, 17.0, 95.0, 151.0, 218.0, 180.0, 76.0, and 308.0 in the terrestrial biotic samples, which are absent in abiotic meteorites suggests that these unknown compounds may serve as unique terrestrial biomarkers.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 10, 17, 18, 19, 22, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, Iceland Soil, Atacama, Utah soil Soil, GSFC soil Soil, Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_six",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of Methylindan and Indane in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 suggests a common formation pathway or source for these two compounds within these meteorites.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 11, 23, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311"

        {
            "id": "H_seven",
            "statement": "Assuming that the tentative identification of Tetrame thylindene is correct, its presence in only terrestrial soils (Iceland and GSFC) indicates that it is likely a biosignature specific to the terrestrial environment.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 20, Iceland Soil, GSFC soil Soil"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_eight",
            "statement": "The identification of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene in Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan may suggest that it serves as an intermediate in the production of more complex PAHs, while also suggesting that the pathway to produce it is not present in the other meteorites.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 36, Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan"
