        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8) and Indane (C9H10), both relatively volatile and simple aromatic hydrocarbons, exclusively in the Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311) suggests that the parent bodies of these meteorites experienced a specific type of low-temperature, short-duration heating event that favored the formation or preservation of these compounds, but not in other meteorites. The absence of these compounds in the other meteorites implies different thermal histories or source compositions.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (ID 7): ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, LEW 85311; Indane (ID 11): ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of Naphthalene, 2-Methyl Naphthalene, and 1-Methyl Naphthalene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and Murchison, and LEW 85311 suggests that the formation pathways and preservation mechanisms of these aromatic compounds were similar across the parent bodies of these meteorites. This also suggests either a common formation environment or cross-contamination of these compounds on the parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (ID 1): Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311; 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2): Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311; 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8): Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The identification of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3), a sulfur-containing heterocyclic compound, in both Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests a unique sulfurization process or precursor in the parent bodies of these CM chondrites, distinct from the processes that have been active in the parent bodies of other meteorites. This might be related to specific aqueous conditions or sulfur availability.",
            "key_datapoints": "1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27): Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The presence of a GC column contaminant (ID 3, ID 6, ID 21 and ID 22) in the biotic soil samples and Orgueil meteorite and its absence from other meteorites suggests that Orgueil may have been exposed to terrestrial contamination in a way that the other meteorites were not.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 3, ID 6, ID 21, ID 22, Orgueil meteorite, Iceland Soil, Jarosite Soil, Antarctica Soil, Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil, Utah soil Soil, Murchison Soil"

        {
            "id": "H_five",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of fluoranthene and pyrene across various meteorite samples (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, and Orgueil) indicates that these two PAHs may have been formed through similar formation pathways or that their co-preservation is favored by the conditions present in their respective parent bodies.",
            "key_datapoints": "Fluoranthene (ID 12): ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; Pyrene (ID 13): Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311"
