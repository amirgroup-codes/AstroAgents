            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of Tetrame thylindene (C13H18) exclusively in Iceland and GSFC soils suggests these soils share unique environmental conditions promoting the formation of this compound, such as specific microbial communities or geochemical processes not present in the other soil samples. It's possible there's a common origin of the precursor molecules, such as related plant matter or microbial inputs.",

            "statement": "The co-occurrence of specific, unidentified compounds (m/z 123.0 & 138.0) and identified terpenes or sesquiterpenes exclusively in the Iceland Soil, Atacama, and GSFC soil samples may indicate a link between the formation of the unknown compounds and the presence of terpenoid precursors within these soil environments. This link could be related to a specific degradation pathway for the terpenes/sesquiterpenes.",

The observed co-occurrence may represent a more robust signature for future in-situ exploration.",

            "statement": "The detection of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3) only in the aqueously altered meteorites Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests that this organosulfur molecule is produced or concentrated under aqueous conditions.  Its absence from Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, and Jbilet Winselwan indicates that its formation may be sensitive to specific environmental conditions, such as pH or redox potential, that are not universally present in aqueously altered meteorites.",

            "statement": "The identification of Dichlorobenzene (C6H4Cl2) specifically in the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites but absent from the other meteorites suggests that past exposure to chlorine-rich fluids or processes may have uniquely affected the halogenation of the aromatic compounds in these meteorites, compared to the other meteorites.",
