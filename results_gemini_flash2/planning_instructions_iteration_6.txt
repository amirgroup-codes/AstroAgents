    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on the distribution of aromatic compounds in meteorites, particularly the naphthalenes, indanes, and related compounds. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **Naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl Naphthalene (ID 2), 1-Methyl Naphthalene (ID 8):** Analyze the co-occurrence of these compounds across both meteorites and terrestrial samples. Consider potential abiotic and biotic sources, and whether their presence is primarily driven by contamination or inherent to the samples.\n*   **Indane (ID 11) and Methylindan (ID 23):** Focus on the restricted presence of these compounds in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311). Develop hypotheses about unique formation pathways in the Antarctic environment. Consider the role of low-temperature chemistry and radiation.\n*   **Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene with the formula C13H12 (ID 32), Acenaphthene (ID 33):** Focus on the restricted presence of these compounds in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LEW 85311).\nYour goal is to determine if there are unique formation pathways or preservation conditions that explain the observed distribution of these aromatic compounds and alkylnaphthalenes.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your focus is on the Orgueil and LEW 85311 meteorites, and the specific PAHs and related compounds identified within them. Consider the formation and alteration processes that could lead to the unique distributions observed. Your specific tasks are:\n\n*   **Fluoranthene (ID 12) and Pyrene (ID 13):** Investigate the co-occurrence of these PAHs in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311 but not in Aguas Zarcas and Jbilet Winselwan. Formulate hypotheses about the formation environment and the role of aqueous alteration.\n*   **Dibenzothiophene (ID 14):** Focus on its presence in Orgueil and LEW 85311 and its absence elsewhere. Consider the conditions that might favor its formation or preservation.\n*   **Trimethyl Naphthalene (ID 15), Phenanthrene or anthracene (ID 42), Biphenyl (ID 43), 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44), Dimethylpyrene (ID 45):** Focus on their presence in Orgueil and LEW 85311 and their absence elsewhere. Consider the conditions that might favor their formation or preservation.\nYour goal is to explain the unique chemical signatures of Orgueil and LEW 85311 and what they reveal about the conditions on the parent bodies.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your focus is on compounds unique to certain soils and meteorites, and the processes that generate them. Your specific task is to determine the geochemical conditions that favor these processes. You should focus on the following compounds:\n\n*   **Possible terpene or sesquiterpene compounds (IDs 4, 17, 18):** Focus on their presence in terrestrial soils from Iceland, Rio Tinto, Atacama, Utah, and GSFC and their absence in other samples. Develop hypotheses about in-situ formation by microbial metabolisms adapted to specific geochemical environments.\n*   **1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27):** Analyze its presence solely in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311. Develop hypotheses about the reactions and organosulfur precursors that lead to its formation.\n*   **Dichlorobenzene (ID 29), Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- (ID 30), and o-Cymene (C13H12) (ID 31):** Focus on their co-occurrence in Orgueil and Murchison only. Develop hypotheses about how these compounds are related to aqueous chemistry.\n*   **Unknowns (IDs 34, 35, 36, 37):** Formulate hypotheses about the unknown compounds present in Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan, and their potential relationship to environmental conditions.\nYour goal is to identify the key geochemical and environmental factors that control the formation and preservation of these compounds, and how they relate to biotic or abiotic processes."
