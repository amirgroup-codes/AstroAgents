    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on the distribution of naphthalene and its methylated derivatives (2-Methyl Naphthalene, 1-Methyl naphthalene, Trimethyl naphthalene). Specifically, investigate the co-occurrence of these compounds in both meteorite samples (Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311) and the Green River Shale soil, considering their absence in other soil samples. Explore potential formation pathways and stability factors that could explain this distribution. Focus on compounds ID 1, 2, 8, 15.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Investigate the occurrence and relationships between the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in the meteorite samples, namely Fluoranthene, Pyrene, Phenanthrene or anthracene, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene, Dibenzo thiophene, Biphenyl, 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one, Dimethylpyrene. Consider the potential origins of these compounds in the interstellar medium (ISM) and their survival during parent body processes. Pay attention to the distribution across different meteorite types and the implications for understanding their formation and alteration histories. Focus on compounds ID 12, 13, 14, 36, 42, 43, 44, 45.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Focus on the compounds found exclusively or predominantly in specific meteorite samples and attempt to correlate their presence with known characteristics of those meteorites. Specifically, analyze the presence of Dimethyl Cyclohexane (C8H16) in LEW 85311 and EET 96029, Acenaphthene (C12H10), Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene with the formula C13H12, Methylindan (C10H12) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311. Research the literature for potential explanations related to thermal history, aqueous alteration, or other relevant processes that could explain their unique distribution. Focus on compounds ID 5, 20, 23, 25, 32, 33, 35, 37."
