            "statement": "The presence of specific compounds like Dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16), Methylindan (C10H12), and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (C14H14) in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311) suggests that even under extreme environmental conditions, certain cyclic aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons can be preserved over long periods. This could be due to their inherent stability or presence within protective mineral matrices.",

            "statement": "The co-occurrence of Naphthalene (C10H8), 2-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10), 1-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10), Pyrene (C16H10), and Fluoranthene (C16H10) in both the Orgueil meteorite (CI1) and the studied Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311) indicates a shared formation environment or source material within the early solar system. It also suggests that aqueous alteration was not strong enough to remove these compounds.",

If such compounds were found on another planetary body, they would not be strong biosignatures.",

The presence of these internal standards across multiple samples points to a consistent baseline level of contamination that is inherent to the method and not necessarily indicative of the sample.",

The presence of these compounds suggests that these PAHs are relatively stable and can be preserved under different environmental conditions.",

The absence of this compound from the other samples serves as a negative control for the analysis performed in the non-terrestrial samples.",

The presence of these compounds and their absence from the abiotic samples in the dataset could be used as a benchmark for future space exploration missions.",
