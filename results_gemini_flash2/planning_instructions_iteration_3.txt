    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on understanding the distribution and potential formation pathways of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) in the abiotic meteorite samples. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **PAH Distribution and Aqueous Alteration:** Analyze the relative abundance of fluoranthene (C16H10) and pyrene (C16H10) (IDs 12 & 13) in Orgueil compared to other abiotic samples. Determine if the data supports the hypothesis that aqueous alteration leads to a relative increase in larger PAHs in highly altered meteorites. Consider the ratios of these compounds within each meteorite and how they correlate with known aqueous alteration levels. Focus on Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101 and LEW 85311.\n*   **Formation pathway of Naphthalene and 2-Methylnaphthalene:** Analyze the presence of Naphthalene (ID 1) and 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2) in the abiotic samples. Determine if the data supports a common formation pathway on the meteorite parent body. Focus on Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, and Aguas Zarcas. Determine if there are any correlations between the abundances of these two compounds across the different samples.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your focus is on the characterization of organic compounds in the terrestrial soil samples and the identification of potential biosignatures. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **Hydrothermal Activity and Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Generation:** Examine the presence of unknown compounds (IDs 38, 39, 40, 41) in the Green River Shale and Lignite Soil samples. Determine if these unknown compounds can be classified as aliphatic hydrocarbons. Assess whether the data supports the hypothesis that hydrothermal activity in organic-rich terrestrial environments can be a source of aliphatic hydrocarbons. \n*   **Influence of Biological Material on Soil Composition:** Study the presence of compounds with positive mass defects in the soil samples, specifically Iceland Soil, Atacama, Utah soil, GSFC soil, Rio Tinto Soil, and Murchison Soil. Determine if these compounds are unique to the soil samples and if they support the hypothesis that terrestrial soil samples are rich in biological material.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your focus is on the analysis of specific aromatic compounds in Antarctic meteorites and their potential origin. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **Preservation of Pre-Solar Material in Antarctic Meteorites:** Analyze the presence of Toluene (ID 7) and Indane (ID 11) in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311). Investigate if the co-occurrence of these compounds supports the hypothesis that they could be pre-solar in origin. Compare the abundance of these compounds across the three Antarctic meteorite samples to identify any potential trends. Also, investigate the presence and abundance of Methylindan (ID 23), Acenaphthene (ID 33), Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene (ID 32) in the same Antarctic meteorites. Determine if their presence alongside Toluene and Indane provides additional support for a common origin or formation pathway."
