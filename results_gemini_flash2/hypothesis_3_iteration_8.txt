        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of naphthalene (ID 1, C10H8) and 2-methyl naphthalene (ID 2, C11H10) in both biotic (Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil) and abiotic (meteorites) samples suggests that these compounds can be formed through both biotic and abiotic processes, making them less reliable as sole indicators of life in extraterrestrial environments. Their co-occurrence indicates they may derive from related precursor molecules or similar formation mechanisms regardless of origin.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (ID 1, C10H8): Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311, Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil. 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2, C11H10): Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311, Green River Shale soil. These compounds appear to be ubiquitous."

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of toluene (ID 7, C7H8), 2-methylnaphthalene (ID 2, C11H10), 1-methylnaphthalene (ID 8, C11H10), fluoranthene (ID 12, C16H10), and pyrene (ID 13, C16H10) in the Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 meteorites suggests a common formation pathway or source for these aromatic compounds within the parent bodies of these meteorites. This suite of compounds could represent a baseline aromatic composition in the early solar system.",
            "key_datapoints": "Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 share all of these compounds."

        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The absence of the tetracyclic aromatic compounds (C18H10) fluoranthene and pyrene (ID 12 and 13) in the thermally metamorphosed EET 96029 meteorite, but presence of the lower mass fragments like methylindan (ID 23, C10H12), may imply that thermal metamorphism causes the cracking of larger aromatics into smaller species. This may also imply that smaller aromatics are easier to make under intense thermal conditions.",
            "key_datapoints": "Fluoranthene (ID 12, C16H10) and Pyrene (ID 13, C16H10) present in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311. Methylindan (ID 23, C10H12) present in ALH 83100, LON 94101. EET 96029, CK5 chondrite, is thermally metamorphosed."

            "statement": "The detection of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27, C2H4S3) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311, both CM-type meteorites, may indicate that the presence of this sulfur-containing species is associated with aqueous alteration conditions on the parent bodies of these meteorites. The co-occurrence suggests a possible role for sulfur in the aqueous alteration process.",
            "key_datapoints": "1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27, C2H4S3) present in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311."

            "statement": "The presence of a possible terpene or sesquiterpene (ID 4, ID 17, ID 18, m/z 138.0, 70.0, 95.0) in Iceland Soil, Rio Tinto Soil, Atacama Soil, and GSFC soil indicates that these molecules may not be unique indicators of life, as they can be produced by abiotic processes or may be ubiquitous environmental contaminants.",
            "key_datapoints": "ID 4, ID 17, and ID 18 present in Iceland Soil, Rio Tinto Soil, Atacama Soil, and GSFC soil. Rio Tinto soil and Atacama Soil are extreme environments with minimal biological activity."

            "statement": "The detection of a dichlorobenzene (ID 29, C6H4Cl2) only in the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites suggests a possible pre-solar origin, as these meteorites are considered to have retained a high degree of primitive pre-solar material. The synthesis of these compounds may have been possible in the environment surrounding the early solar system.",
            "key_datapoints": "Dichlorobenzene (ID 29, C6H4Cl2) present in the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites."

            "statement": "The presence of the peak at m/z 218.0 (ID 34) in both Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan, but absent in the other meteorites, suggests that the molecule producing this peak may be linked to aqueous alteration, impact shock, or a combination of both processes as these are the two defining events for these meteorites. However, because the molecule is unknown, no further inferences can be made.",
            "key_datapoints": "m/z 218.0 (ID 34) present in both Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan, Unknown molecule formula."
