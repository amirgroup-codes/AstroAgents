            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of naphthalene (ID 1) and 2-methyl naphthalene (ID 2) in meteorites (Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311) and a terrestrial shale (Green River Shale soil) suggests a common formation or preservation mechanism across diverse environments. This could imply that relatively simple PAHs are either easily synthesized abiotically or are robust enough to persist despite geological processing on Earth and different parent body alteration on asteroids.",

This could be due to the thermal decomposition of the GC column during the experiment.",

The absence of large PAHs is consistent with the low temperature formation of these compounds.",

The process could be caused by the cracking of larger PAH molecules, which would be consistent with both hydrothermal and UV irradiation.",

The hydrogenation could occur through gas-grain reactions in the interstellar medium or by aqueous alteration on the meteorite parent body.",
