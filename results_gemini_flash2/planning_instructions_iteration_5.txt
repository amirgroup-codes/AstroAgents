    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your primary focus is to investigate the diversity of aromatic core structures across the meteorite samples. Specifically, analyze the presence and absence patterns of Naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2), Toluene (ID 7), 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8), Indane (ID 11), Fluoranthene (ID 12), Pyrene (ID 13), and Biphenyl (ID 43) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311, and EET 96029 meteorites. Your goal is to determine if the *combination* of these compounds can be used to differentiate between carbonaceous chondrite classes and understand how these compounds relate to the formation environment of the meteorites. Formulate hypotheses based on the observed patterns, focusing on the relative presence or absence of these compounds rather than absolute abundances.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your primary task is to investigate the distribution of potential terrestrial compounds and their association with local terrestrial processes. Analyze the occurrence of possible terpene or sesquiterpene (ID 4, 17, 18), unknown compound 123.0 m/z (ID 10), unknown compound 151.0 m/z (ID 19), Tetrame thylindene (ID 20), unknown compound 62.0 m/z (ID 26), unknown compound 154.0 m/z (ID 38), unknown compound 76.0 m/z (ID 39), unknown compound 308.0 m/z (ID 40), and unknown compound 180.0 m/z (ID 41) within the Iceland Soil, Atacama, Utah soil, GSFC soil, Rio Tinto Soil, Green River Shale soil, and Lignite Soil samples. Pay close attention to which compounds are found in which specific soil types. Formulate hypotheses regarding the link between the presence of these compounds and the specific environmental conditions of each soil type. Also, analyze the presence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27) in Aguas Zarcas, and LEW 85311.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your task is to focus on Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds (HACs) and other specific aromatic compounds, and investigate their relevance as indicators of specific alteration pathways in meteorites. Analyze the presence and absence patterns of Dibenzo thiophene (ID 14), Trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15), Methylindan (ID 23), Dimethyl cyclohexane (ID 25), Dichlorobenzene (ID 29), Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one (ID 30), o-Cymene (ID 31), Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene (ID 32), Acenaphthene (ID 33), Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene (ID 35), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (ID 36), Dimethyl naphthalene (ID 37), Phenanthrene or anthracene (ID 42), 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44), and Dimethylpyrene (ID 45) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311, and EET 96029 meteorites. Formulate hypotheses about how the presence of these compounds might indicate specific alteration pathways that have occurred on the meteorite parent bodies. Consider why these compounds are not ubiquitously found across all meteorite samples."
