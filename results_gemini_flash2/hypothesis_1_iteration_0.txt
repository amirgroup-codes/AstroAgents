        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of specific PAHs (Fluoranthene and Pyrene) in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311) suggests a common formation environment or source for these organic compounds in the early solar system before incorporation into distinct meteorite parent bodies.  The detection of these compounds indicates that these molecules can survive the processes of meteorite formation and delivery to Earth.",
            "key_datapoints": "Fluoranthene (C16H10) and Pyrene (C16H10) are detected in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 (ID 12 and 13)"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The detection of Toluene (C7H8) in both Orgueil and Murchison meteorite, with a lack of detection in the other samples, suggests the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites experienced a similar degree of volatile organic contamination post-impact on Earth. This could be due to similar terrestrial storage conditions or handling procedures.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (C7H8) is detected in both Orgueil and Murchison meteorite (ID 7)."
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of Naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, and LEW 85311 indicates that these PAHs are either co-synthesized or that the methylation of naphthalene is a common diagenetic process occurring on the parent bodies of these meteorites. The presence of both compounds in both biotic and abiotic samples suggests that the presence of these two compounds is not a good indicator of life.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10) presence in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311, Green River Shale soil, and Lignite Soil (ID 1 and 2)"
        },
        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The detection of internal GC column contaminants (e.g., at 355.0 m/z) in both biotic and abiotic samples indicates a consistent source of procedural contamination affecting both types of samples. This highlights the challenges of differentiating indigenous signals from background noise in extraterrestrial sample analysis.",
            "key_datapoints": "Internal contaminants at 355.0 m/z are detected in both biotic and abiotic samples (ID 3)."

            "statement": "The presence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests that there was low-temperature aqueous alteration occurring on the parent asteroids that led to the formation of these specific organosulfur compounds. This further suggests that the original organic make-up of the parent bodies for Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 may be similar.",
            "key_datapoints": "1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3) is detected in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 (ID 27)."
