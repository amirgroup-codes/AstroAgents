**Revised Analysis of Abiotic and Biotic Molecular Signatures in Extraterrestrial and Terrestrial Samples**

**Data Overview and Limitations**

The GCxGC-HRMS analysis of the provided samples offers insights into the molecular composition of both extraterrestrial (meteorites) and terrestrial (geologically processed and soil) materials. However, the analysis is subject to several limitations:

*   **Lack of Quantification:** The absence of precise quantification for many compounds hinders statistical comparisons and limits the strength of any proposed relationships.
*   **Instrumental Bias:** The reliance on a single analytical technique and a lack of understanding of R2PI efficiencies introduces potential biases in compound detection.
*   **Compound Identification Ambiguity:** Many compounds are only tentatively identified, reducing the robustness of any conclusions drawn from their presence or absence.
*   **Potential for Contamination:** Environmental contamination is a serious challenge, particularly in the terrestrial samples.

To address these limitations, this analysis focuses on identifying only robust patterns supported by multiple data points and well-characterized compounds, proposing more specific mechanisms for compound formation and preservation, and acknowledging the potential for terrestrial contamination.

**Key Findings and Revised Hypotheses:**

Here are the key findings from the data table, organized by compound and sample type, followed by revised hypotheses addressing the specific limitations of the original analysis.

**1. Naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-Methyl Naphthalene (C11H10)**

*   **Occurrence:** Detected in the majority of meteorite samples (Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311) and the Green River Shale soil (a terrestrial geologically processed sample).
*   **Absence:** Not detected in the soil samples from Iceland, Atacama, Utah, GSFC, and Rio Tinto.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_1_revised**: The widespread co-occurrence of naphthalene and 2-methyl naphthalene in both extraterrestrial (carbonaceous chondrites) and terrestrial (Green River Shale) samples is likely a result of their relative stability and low molecular weight, which enables their survival during geological processing and limits the information that can be obtained from the two molecules as independent biosignatures.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis acknowledges the ubiquity of naphthalene and its methylated derivative. It emphasizes the role of stability and low molecular weight, which would allow these compounds to survive diverse environmental conditions and, therefore, limits its usefulness as a biosignature.

**2. Fluoranthene (C16H10) and Pyrene (C16H10) and related compounds**

*   **Occurrence:** Detected in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311 and Orgueil.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_2_revised**: The co-occurrence of toluene, 1-methylnaphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and dibenzo thiophene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, and LEW 85311 suggests that the presence of these compounds in meteorites is the result of diverse formation pathways in the ISM and that these compounds are robust enough to survive parent body processes.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis emphasizes the co-occurrence of these PAHs and suggests that they are the result of diverse formation pathways in the ISM and that these compounds are robust enough to survive parent body processes.

**3. Dimethyl Cyclohexane (C8H16)**

*   **Occurrence:** Detected only in LEW 85311 and EET 96029.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_3_revised**: The presence of dimethyl cyclohexane in LEW 85311 and EET 96029 may be the result of the high volatility of this compound, and its detection may be unrelated to the thermal history of the meteorite samples.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis emphasizes the volatility and, therefore, the possibility of the detection being unrelated to the thermal history of the meteorite samples.

**4. 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (C14H14)**

*   **Occurrence:** Detected only in Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_4_revised**: The presence of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene in Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan, may stem from similar aqueous processes on their parent bodies, however, given the lack of data, the claim cannot be supported and requires more study.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis is more cautious, acknowledging the uncertainty and calling for further study.

**5. 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3)**

*   **Occurrence:** Detected only in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_5_revised**: The presence of the highly unusual molecule 1,2,4-Trithiolane in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 may be the result of terrestrial contamination, and the claim requires more testing.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis is emphasizes terrestrial contamination.

**6. Common Compounds in Antarctic Meteorites**

*   **Occurrence:** Toluene, Methylindan, Fluoranthene, Pyrene, Dibenzo thiophene,  Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene with the formula C13H12 were detected in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_6_revised**: The detection of similar compounds in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311, may be the result of contamination from the Antarctic continent, rather than common source regions or similar parent body processes.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis emphasizes terrestrial contamination.

**7. Fluoranthene and Pyrene Absent in EET 96029**

*   **Occurrence:** The thermally metamorphosed meteorite EET 96029 does not have Fluoranthene and Pyrene, but has Methylindan.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_7_revised**: The absence of the tetracyclic aromatic compounds (C18H10) fluoranthene and pyrene (ID 12 and 13) in the thermally metamorphosed EET 96029 meteorite, but the presence of the lower mass fragments like methylindan (ID 23, C10H12), may imply that thermal metamorphism causes the cracking of larger aromatics into smaller species, or the rapid decomposition of the compounds. The cracking may be a result of the high temperatures of the meteorite during atmospheric entry.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis includes a more specific theory from the Literature about the atmospheric entry.

**8. m/z 218.0 Peak and Alteration Processes**

*   **Occurrence:** The m/z 218.0 peak is only found in Orgueil and Jbilet Winselwan

**Revised Hypothesis:**

*   **H_8_revised**: Due to the unknown nature of the molecule producing the m/z 218.0 peak, and the presence of this peak in only two meteorite samples, the presence of the peak is likely the result of terrestrial contamination.

**Justification:** This revised hypothesis is emphasizes terrestrial contamination.

**General Summary**

This refined analysis reflects a more conservative interpretation of the data, acknowledging the limitations of the analytical methods and the potential for contamination. The revised hypotheses are more specific, focusing on testable mechanisms for compound formation, preservation, and degradation.

**Actionable Steps:**

To improve the scientific robustness of future research, we recommend the following:

*   **Quantitative Analysis:** Implement methods for accurate quantification of all detected compounds.
*   **Isomer Separation:** Employ techniques capable of separating and identifying isomers.
*   **Compound Confirmation:** Prioritize the identification of unknown compounds through comparison with standards and spectral libraries.
*   **Contamination Control:** Implement rigorous contamination control protocols and blank analyses.
*   **Additional Analytical Techniques:** Supplement GCxGC-HRMS with complementary techniques, such as Raman Spectroscopy or compound-specific isotope analysis, to obtain additional information about the samples.
