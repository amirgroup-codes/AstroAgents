    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on the distribution and potential formation mechanisms of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) in the meteorite samples, with a particular emphasis on methylation patterns and aqueous alteration effects. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **Naphthalene and Methylated Naphthalenes (IDs 1, 2, 8):** Analyze the ratio of methylated to non-methylated naphthalenes in the meteorite samples, comparing CM chondrites with varying degrees of aqueous alteration (e.g., ALH 83100, LEW 85311, Orgueil, Murchison). Consider whether aqueous alteration selectively removes methylated naphthalenes.\n*   **Fluoranthene and Pyrene (IDs 12, 13):** Examine the fluoranthene to pyrene ratio in the meteorite samples, focusing on how this ratio varies with the degree of aqueous alteration. Propose a mechanism for how aqueous alteration could affect this ratio.\n*   **Dimethylpyrene (ID 45):** Investigate the presence of dimethylpyrene in Orgueil and LEW 85311. Consider the role of phyllosilicates in the formation of dimethylpyrene through aqueous alteration of smaller PAHs.\n*   **Toluene (ID 7):** Analyze the presence of Toluene in the meteorite samples and its potential relationship to thermal cracking of larger alkylaromatic compounds, and how aqueous alteration affects the presence of this volatile compound.\n\nYour goal is to formulate specific, testable hypotheses regarding the formation and alteration of PAHs in meteorites based on the observed distributions and ratios. Consider the limitations of the data (semi-quantitative nature) and propose experiments to validate your hypotheses.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your primary focus is on the analysis of the soil samples, particularly those from extreme environments (Iceland, Rio Tinto, Atacama, Antarctica), and how their unique characteristics influence the organic compounds present. Specifically, investigate the following:\n\n*   **Terpene Fragments (IDs 4, 17, 18):** Analyze the presence of small terpene fragments (m/z 70.0 and 95.0) in Iceland and Rio Tinto soils. Develop a hypothesis for why these fragments are present in these soils but not in others, relating it to the unique biota and decomposition processes in these extreme environments.\n*   **Unknown Compounds (IDs 10, 16, 19):** Examine the unknown compounds present in the soil samples (Iceland, Atacama, GSFC, Antarctica, Utah, Murchison). Identify any patterns or correlations between the presence of these compounds and the specific soil type. Can you suggest possible classes of compounds based on their m/z values and retention times?\n*   **Green River Shale Soil and Lignite Soil (IDs 38, 39, 40, 41):** Examine the unknown compounds present in Green River Shale soil and Lignite Soil. Identify any patterns or correlations between the presence of these compounds and the specific soil type. Can you suggest possible classes of compounds based on their m/z values and retention times?\n\nYour goal is to formulate specific, testable hypotheses regarding the relationship between soil characteristics, biota, and the organic compounds present. Consider the potential for unique metabolic pathways and decomposition processes in extreme environments.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your task is to investigate the occurrence and potential formation pathways of sulfur-containing compounds in the meteorite samples. Focus on the following:\n\n*   **1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27):** Investigate the presence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311. Develop a hypothesis regarding the formation of this compound, considering the potential role of aqueous alteration and polysulfides. Explain the absence of alkylated homologues.\n*   **Dibenzo thiophene (ID 14):** Analyze the presence of Dibenzo thiophene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311. Propose possible formation pathways, considering both abiotic and potential biotic sources.\n*   **Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene (ID 32):** Analyze the presence of Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene in ALH 83100 and LEW 85311. Propose possible formation pathways, considering both abiotic and potential biotic sources.\n*   **Acenaphthene (ID 33):** Analyze the presence of Acenaphthene in ALH 83100 and LEW 85311. Propose possible formation pathways, considering both abiotic and potential biotic sources.\n\nYour goal is to formulate specific, testable hypotheses regarding the formation and alteration of sulfur-containing compounds in meteorites, focusing on plausible chemical reactions and environmental conditions."
