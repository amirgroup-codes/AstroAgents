            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of both naphthalene (ID 1, MW 102) and 2-methylnaphthalene (ID 2, MW 142) in Orgueil suggests a low-temperature formation pathway or incomplete processing of these PAHs on the Orgueil parent body, as higher temperatures or more extensive processing would likely favor the thermodynamically more stable, less alkylated naphthalene. The co-occurrence indicates a shared origin, possibly a common precursor molecule or a related set of formation conditions. Furthermore, it highlights the preservation of relatively labile organic compounds in this meteorite.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (ID 1, MW 102): Orgueil; 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2, MW 142): Orgueil."

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (ID 7, MW 92) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, and LEW 85311, but not in other meteorites, suggests a unique formation or preservation environment specific to the parent bodies of these meteorites or a localized alteration event affecting only these samples. Given that toluene is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon, its presence could indicate either abiotic synthesis pathways or the degradation of more complex organic molecules, with the similar occurrence across CM chondrites indicating similar aqueous alteration",

Since these compounds are structurally isomeric, similar formation conditions are probable.",

Given the aqueous alteration of CM chondrites, This could be from hydrothermal fluids.",

            "statement": "The limited distribution of internal contaminants (IDs 3, 6, 21, and 22) suggests that the samples were not uniformly exposed to terrestrial contamination during analysis, implying that any widespread compounds detected are more likely to be indigenous to the samples than artifacts from the GC column.",

            "statement": "The identification of dimethyl cyclohexane (ID 25, MW 55) exclusively in LEW 85311 and EET 96029 indicates the presence of unique organic source material or specific formation conditions on the parent bodies of these Antarctic meteorites. Given that both are CM chondrites, the presence indicates unique conditions on the CM parent body.",

Given that both are highly studied and both are CM, it could have a unique CM chemistry.",

Given their related structures, this may indicate a similar source.",
