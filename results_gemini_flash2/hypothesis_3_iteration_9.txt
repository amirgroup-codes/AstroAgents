        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8, ID 7) and dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16, ID 25) exclusively in the Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, and EET 96029) indicates contamination during their residence in the Antarctic ice. These compounds, common in terrestrial solvents and fuels, likely infiltrated the meteorites during their prolonged contact with meltwater within the Antarctic ice sheet.  The detection of toluene and dimethyl cyclohexane together could suggest a shared source of contamination, possibly related to the materials used in the meteorite collection process or storage in Antarctica.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (C7H8, ID 7), Dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16, ID 25), ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, EET 96029"

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The unique detection of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3, ID 27) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests a specific alteration pathway or source material present in these meteorites but absent in others. 1,2,4-Trithiolane is an organosulfur, which points to hydrothermal activity on the parent body, but is not well understood. The co-occurrence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane with PAHs in the most aqueously altered meteorites could also suggest the presence of highly reduced organic species, such as sulfides and thioethers, which would be of exobiological significance.",

        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of specific unknown compounds and the internal contaminants from the GC column in the ice and altered biotic soils suggests that the instrument may be overwhelmed by matrix effects or that the GC is not working as designed. For instance, the instrument may have been saturated by the internal contaminants. This would limit the detection of other compounds or generate new artifact peaks.",

            "statement": "The identification of compounds (ID 30 & 31), suggestive of terpenes (Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)-) and cymene (o-Cymene), only in Murchison and Orgueil suggests these meteorites experienced a unique form of parent body processing not shared by the Antarctic meteorites. This suggests localized regions on the parent bodies experienced different alteration processes, and the specific alteration history was different than the Antarctic meteorites in this study.",
            "key_datapoints": "Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- (ID 30), o-Cymene (ID 31), Murchison, Orgueil"

            "statement": "The co-detection of compounds indicative of biological sources (possible terpene or sesquiterpene (Low confidence) ID 4 and 18) with compounds indicative of environmental contamination (Diethyl Phthalate or another phthalate (likely environmental contamination) ID 9), the detection of a specific molecular feature requires careful assessment of environmental contamination. High concentrations of environmental contaminants can mimic the presence of true biosignatures and create false positives.",
