    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1: Focus on the distribution and potential formation pathways of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3, ID 27) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311. Investigate the geochemical context of these meteorites, specifically looking for evidence of oxidizing agents (e.g., iron oxides, perchlorates) or reactive minerals (e.g., sulfides, clays) that could promote its formation. Based on your findings, develop hypotheses about the specific environmental conditions that led to the presence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane in these meteorites, considering both abiotic and potential biotic (though unlikely) origins. Consider also the potential role of parent body aqueous alteration. Ensure that any proposed formation pathways are chemically plausible within the known conditions of carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2: Analyze the data related to naphthalene and methylnaphthalene isomers (IDs 1, 2, 8). Specifically, investigate the relative abundance of 1-Methylnaphthalene vs 2-Methylnaphthalene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and Murchison. Develop a hypothesis explaining any observed variations in these ratios. This hypothesis should consider factors such as aqueous alteration, differential solubility, and potential formation pathways on the parent body. Consider the impact of aqueous alteration processes on the observed ratios. Given that 2-Methylnaphthalene is slightly more water-soluble than 1-Methylnaphthalene, could preferential leaching during aqueous alteration explain the observed variations? Propose specific experiments to test your hypothesis, such as measuring the isomers' relative abundance in water extracts of these meteorites. Note that this is only a hypothesis generating task, so you do not need to perform the experiments.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3: Focus on the presence and formation of indane (C9H10, ID 11), toluene (C7H8, ID 7), and dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16, ID 25) in the Antarctic meteorites ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311. Disregard dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16, ID 25). Formulate a hypothesis regarding the observed presence of indane (C9H10, ID 11) and toluene (C7H8, ID 7) in the Antarctic meteorites. Consider the possibility that the parent body environment of the meteorites was particularly conducive to the efficient hydrogenation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to produce indane. Develop a testable prediction based on your hypothesis, such as further analysis of the hydrogenation level of the other PAHs in the samples."
