        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8) and indane (C9H10) exclusively in Antarctic CM chondrites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311) suggests a unique formation environment or source for these compounds specific to or concentrated by Antarctic ice sheet processes, separate from the general PAH formation pathways in other carbonaceous chondrites. This could involve low-temperature aqueous alteration or terrestrial weathering processes within the Antarctic environment.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (ID 7), Indane (ID 11), ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311."

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of fluoranthene (C16H10, ID 12) and pyrene (C16H10, ID 13) with dibenzo thiophene (C12H8S, ID 14) and trimethyl naphthalene (C13H14, ID 15) in Orgueil and LEW 85311 indicates a shared origin or alteration pathway for sulfur-containing HACs and PAHs in these meteorites. This pathway might involve parent body aqueous alteration or high degrees of metamorphism.",

            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The presence of compounds indicative of petroleum contamination and/or compounds commonly found in terrestrial soils (diethyl phthalate, dimethyl cyclohexane, 1,2,4-Trithiolane, Ergost-14-ene) in the Iceland, Rio Tinto, Utah, GSFC, Murchison, and Lignite soil samples suggests a global distribution of these compounds that could lead to false positives in extraterrestrial exploration missions. These compounds are good target contaminants to account for during data processing.",
