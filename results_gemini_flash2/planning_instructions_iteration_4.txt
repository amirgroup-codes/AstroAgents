    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on investigating the relationship between aqueous alteration and the formation of specific organic molecules in meteorites. Specifically, analyze the data for evidence supporting or refuting the following hypotheses, focusing on the meteorites Orgueil, ALH 83100, Murchison, LON 94101, LEW 85311, Aguas Zarcas, and Jbilet Winselwan. Your tasks include: \n\n1.  **Methylnaphthalene Formation (H1):** Evaluate the co-occurrence of 1-Methylnaphthalene (ID 8) and 2-Methylnaphthalene (ID 2) and their ratio in the specified meteorites. Consider how low-temperature aqueous alteration might influence the kinetic control of naphthalene methylation. \n2.  **1,2,4-Trithiolane Formation (H5):** Investigate the presence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27) in relation to aqueous alteration, specifically in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311. Hypothesize about the reducing conditions and the presence of H2S that could favor its formation.\n3. **Dichlorobenzene Formation (H6):** Investigate the presence of Dichlorobenzene (ID 29) specifically in the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites. Hypothesize about the aqueous alteration by chlorine-rich fluids that may have uniquely affected the halogenation of aromatic compounds on the parent bodies of these meteorites.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your focus is on the distribution and potential origins of PAHs and related compounds in Antarctic meteorites. Analyze the data for evidence supporting or refuting the following hypotheses, concentrating on data from the meteorites ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, and EET 96029. Your tasks include:\n\n1.  **Extraterrestrial Source of PAHs (H2):** Examine the distribution of Naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2), and 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8) in the specified Antarctic meteorites. Consider the possibility of an extraterrestrial source versus Antarctic contamination.\n2.  **Fluoranthene Origin in Antarctic CM2 Meteorites (H4):** Analyze the occurrence of Fluoranthene (ID 12) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 and correlate this with the likelihood of a common formation or alteration process, possibly low-temperature aqueous alteration. Compare it to the presence of pyrene (ID 13).\n3.  **Dimethyl Cyclohexane Formation (H3):** Analyze the presence of Dimethyl cyclohexane (ID 25) in LEW 85311 and EET 96029. Hypothesize about the mineralogical compositions or unique conditions on the surface of the meteorite that facilitate the formation of this compound.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your focus is on investigating the formation pathways of various organic molecules in meteorites, specifically focusing on the potential roles of radiation, precursors, and the interstellar medium. Analyze the data for evidence supporting or refuting the following hypotheses, concentrating on data from the meteorites Orgueil, LEW 85311, and Murchison. Your tasks include:\n\n1.  **Toluene Formation Due to Radiation (H7):** Evaluate the presence of toluene (ID 7) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, and LEW 85311. Formulate a hypothesis about the role of water concentration and radiation in the formation of Toluene.\n2.  **Fluoranthene and Pyrene Formation (H8):** Evaluate the co-occurrence of fluoranthene (ID 12) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311, and the presence of pyrene (ID 13) in LON 94101 and LEW 85311. Formulate a hypothesis about the presence of fluoranthene occurring before pyrene.\n3.  **Formation of Dichlorobenzene and Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one (H9):** Evaluate the co-occurrence of Dichlorobenzene (ID 29) and Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- (ID 30) exclusively in Orgueil and Murchison. Formulate a hypothesis about a common precursor unique to CM chondrites formed in the Interstellar medium.\n4.  **1H-Phenalen-1-one, 9H-Fluoren-9-one, and Biphenyl Formation Due to Radiation (H10):** Evaluate the presence of 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44) exclusively in Orgueil and LEW 85311, and the presence of Biphenyl (ID 43) also in the same meteorites. Formulate a hypothesis about the formation due to radiation."
