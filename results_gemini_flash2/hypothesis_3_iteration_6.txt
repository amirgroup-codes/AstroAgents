    "hypothesis": [
        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8), indane (C9H10), and dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16) specifically in the Antarctic meteorites ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 indicates a unique pre-terrestrial formation environment on their parent body that favored the synthesis and preservation of these relatively simple cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, irrespective of subsequent aqueous alteration levels. This suggests a distinct chemical pathway or environmental condition on the parent body of these Antarctic meteorites compared to other carbonaceous chondrites, leading to the preferential formation and/or preservation of these specific compounds.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (92.0 m/z) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, LEW 85311; Indane (118.0 m/z) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311; Dimethyl cyclohexane (55.0 m/z) in LEW 85311, EET 96029."
        },
        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3) with Naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-Methyl naphthalene (C11H10) in both Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311 suggests a shared formation mechanism or source environment that facilitates the co-synthesis or co-deposition of sulfur-containing heterocycles with simple PAHs. The presence of both types of molecules could be related to specific redox conditions or catalytic surfaces present during their formation on the parent body.",
            "key_datapoints": "1,2,4-Trithiolane (124.0 m/z) in Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311; Naphthalene (102.0 m/z) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311; 2-Methyl naphthalene (142.0 m/z) in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311."
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The detection of specific features (138.0 m/z, 123.0 m/z, 70.0 m/z, 95.0 m/z, and 159.0 m/z), which are possibly related to terpenes or sesquiterpenes, specifically in the terrestrial Iceland, Atacama, and GSFC soils, but not in meteorites, suggests that these compounds are unique indicators of terrestrial biology and have not been transferred to meteorites or are readily destroyed in extraterrestrial environments. These compounds could be biosignatures for terrestrial-like life.",
            "key_datapoints": "Presence of 138.0 m/z, 123.0 m/z, 70.0 m/z, 95.0 m/z, and 159.0 m/z in Iceland Soil, Atacama, and GSFC soil, but absence in meteorite samples."

        {
            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The co-existence of Fluoranthene (C16H10) and Pyrene (C16H10) in the Antarctic meteorites ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311, suggests that these PAHs are co-synthesized or co-deposited by similar processes or that one converts into the other. This could be tested by searching for thermodynamic relationships between these compounds.",
            "key_datapoints": "Detection of both Fluoranthene (202.0 m/z) and Pyrene (202.0 m/z) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311."
