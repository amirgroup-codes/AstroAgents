            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "In CM2 chondrites, the degree of aqueous alteration correlates with the ratio of 1-Methyl naphthalene to 2-Methyl naphthalene, serving as a potential proxy for the extent of parent body processing. Specifically, a lower 1-Methyl naphthalene to 2-Methyl naphthalene ratio indicates higher degree of aqueous alteration.",

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The presence of Indane (C9H10) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311, suggests a unique formation pathway or source specific to the Antarctic CM chondrites that is distinct from the formation environment of Orgueil and other CM chondrites.",

            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The relatively low abundance of high mass PAHs (m/z > 280) in the analyzed samples suggests that the aqueous alteration processes may inhibit the formation and/or promote the breakdown of larger PAHs molecules.",

            "statement": "The presence of alkylated naphthalenes in both the biotic Green River Shale soil and the abiotic carbonaceous chondrites indicates that alkylation processes are not unique to biotic environments and may be influenced by abiotic factors such as aqueous alteration.",
