These compounds may represent a baseline of organic molecules to which further complexification can occur. This contrasts with the soils, which lack consistent detection of these compounds.",

This suggests that aqueous alteration promotes the formation and/or preservation of larger, less volatile PAHs at the expense of smaller, more volatile ones and limits the extent of alkylation.",

This implies that areas with high concentrations of thiophenes may have experienced unique aqueous or redox conditions.",
