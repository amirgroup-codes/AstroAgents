    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on the organosulfur compounds and their implications for aqueous alteration processes in meteorites. Specifically, investigate the presence and absence of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (C2H4S3) - ID 27 - in Aguas Zarcas and LEW 85311. Develop hypotheses regarding the specific conditions that might have led to its formation in these meteorites but not others, considering the mineralogy and alteration history of these samples. Also, analyze the presence and absence of Dibenzo thiophene (C12H8S) - ID 14 - in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311. Formulate hypotheses concerning the aqueous conditions of these meteorites and the presence of Dibenzo thiophene.",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your focus is on the aromatic compounds and their potential as indicators of thermal processing and formation pathways. Specifically, analyze the distribution of Toluene (C7H8) - ID 7 - across the meteorite samples (ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, LEW 85311, Aguas Zarcas, and Jbilet Winselwan). Formulate hypotheses regarding the role of temperature and alteration processes in the presence or absence of toluene. Additionally, investigate the co-occurrence of Dichlorobenzene (C6H4Cl2) - ID 29 - and Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- (C10H16O) - ID 30 - in Orgueil and Murchison, focusing on the unique formation pathways of these compounds. Furthermore, analyze the presence of o-Cymene (C13H12) - ID 31 - in Orgueil and Murchison and its implication on parent body formation.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your focus is on the unidentified compounds in the terrestrial soils and the differences between C3 type meteorites. Your first task is to analyze the presence of the unknown compound with m/z 154.0 - ID 38 - found in Green River Shale soil and Lignite Soil, form hypotheses on the diagenetic pathways involved in its generation. Also, investigate the presence of C14H10 - ID 42 - in Tarda and its absence in Chwichiya 002, creating hypotheses about the different formation pathways of these C3 type meteorites."
