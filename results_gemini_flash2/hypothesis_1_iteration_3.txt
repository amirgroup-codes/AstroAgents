            "statement": "The presence of both 1-Methyl naphthalene and 2-Methyl naphthalene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and Murchison suggests a common formation environment and/or similar parent body processes for these meteorites, evidenced by the co-existence of alkylated and non-alkylated PAHs; this contrasts with formation processes involving just one isomer.",

The common detection suggests preservation occurs regardless of specific Antarctic conditions.",

A further conclusion is that higher temperature of the GC column is not enough to elute those features, since they appear in most of the samples.",
