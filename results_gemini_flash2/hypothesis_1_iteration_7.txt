            "statement": "The presence of specific organic compounds, particularly low molecular weight PAHs and alkylbenzenes, in both abiotic (meteorite) and biotic (terrestrial soil) samples suggest that these compounds may be a common product of both abiotic and biotic processes. Note that the source of energy that drives these processes are very distinct.",

            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of fluoranthene and pyrene in both abiotic and biotic samples implies a common formation pathway independent of biological origin. Their consistent presence in the analyzed samples suggests these PAHs are either very stable, easily formed, or both.",

            "statement": "The presence of certain higher-mass features in the meteoritic samples and some terrestrial samples but not all, such as dimethylpyrene (C18H14), which are not observed in all samples may suggest that the formation of these compounds is matrix-dependent and is not a general outcome of the synthesis of PAHs, or may be below detection limits.",

This byproduct would be an indication that more advanced testing is needed.",
