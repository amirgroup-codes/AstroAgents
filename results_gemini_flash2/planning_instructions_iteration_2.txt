    "Agent1_instructions": "Focus on the distribution and potential formation pathways of PAHs in the meteorite samples, specifically Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311, Jbilet Winselwan, and Murchison. Analyze the co-occurrence of Naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2), Toluene (ID 7), 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8), Indane (ID 11), Fluoranthene (ID 12), Pyrene (ID 13), Dibenzo thiophene (ID 14), Trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15), Methylindan (ID 23), Acenaphthene (ID 33), Phenanthrene or anthracene (ID 42), Biphenyl (ID 43), 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44), Dimethylpyrene (ID 45), and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (ID 36). Investigate potential aqueous alteration effects on PAH ratios and explore possible reaction pathways involving sulfur incorporation into PAHs, paying special attention to the potential formation of 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27).",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Focus on the unique compounds found in the Icelandic, Atacama, Utah, and GSFC soil samples. Investigate the possible biogenic origins or common environmental sources of the compounds in these soil samples, specifically focusing on the co-occurrence of compounds with m/z values 138.0 (ID 4), 116.0 (ID 5), 123.0 (ID 10), 70.0 (ID 17), 95.0 (ID 18), 159.0 (ID 20), and 151.0 (ID 19). Investigate the possibility of a common bacterial or fungal source for these compounds, particularly looking for compounds with potential terpene or sesquiterpene structures. Research the environmental conditions and microbial life in these regions, including their tolerance to stress and capacity for aeolian transport.",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Focus on the unique compounds found in the Antarctic meteorites LEW 85311 and EET 96029. Analyze the co-occurrence of Dimethyl cyclohexane (ID 25), Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene (ID 32), Acenaphthene (ID 33), Dimethyl naphthalene (ID 37), Fluoranthene (ID 12), Pyrene (ID 13), Dibenzo thiophene (ID 14), Trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15), and 1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27). Investigate potential low-temperature thermal events that could have led to the formation of unique compounds or the degradation of larger molecules. Look for evidence of unique processing or alteration in these meteorites compared to the other samples. Also, analyze Ergost-14-ene, (5?)- (ID 28) in Lignite Soil and Murchison Soil, investigate potential origins and formation pathways for this compound in these samples."
