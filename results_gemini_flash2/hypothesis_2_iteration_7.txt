            "statement": "The presence of toluene (C7H8) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, and LEW 85311 meteorites suggests a common formation or alteration process on the parent bodies of these meteorites, potentially related to the breakdown of more complex organic molecules into simpler aromatic hydrocarbons.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (C7H8), ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, LEW 85311"

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The absence of diethyl phthalate in the Orgueil meteorite, while present in Rio Tinto Soil, GSFC soil Soil, and Murchison Soil, suggests either that the Orgueil meteorite was not exposed to this specific terrestrial contaminant or that the organic extraction process was not efficient for that particular component in that matrix. Terrestrial soils show the presence of phthalates, which is consistent with environmental contamination.",

            "statement": "The detection of dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16) in LEW 85311 and EET 96029, but not in the other meteorites, indicates a unique aspect of their formation environment or alteration history that favored the synthesis or preservation of this specific aliphatic compound, potentially a lower degree of aqueous alteration or specific thermal processing.",
            "key_datapoints": "Dimethyl cyclohexane (C8H16), LEW 85311, EET 96029"

            "id": "H_four",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of fluoranthene (C16H10) and pyrene (C16H10) in Orgueil, LON 94101, and LEW 85311, despite their different formation pathways (as suggested by other documents), indicates that the source environment for the organic material in these meteorites might be similar or that later aqueous alteration homogenized the PAH distribution. These processes did not affect other samples, which may have experienced less aqueous alteration.",
            "key_datapoints": "Fluoranthene (C16H10), Pyrene (C16H10), Orgueil, LON 94101, LEW 85311"

They are more aqueously altered.",

Also aqueous alteration might have affected the preservation of 1,2,4-Trithiolane.",
