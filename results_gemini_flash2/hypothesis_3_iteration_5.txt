        {
            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "The detection of toluene, 1-methyl naphthalene, 2-methyl naphthalene, dimethyl naphthalene, indane, fluoranthene, pyrene, and dibenzothiophene in ALH 83100 and LEW 85311, two CM2 Antarctic meteorites, suggests a common pre-terrestrial organic source and comparable taphonomic pathway for these meteorites despite their different find locations.",
            "key_datapoints": "Toluene (ID 7, C7H8), 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8, C11H10), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2, C11H10), Dimethyl naphthalene (ID 37, C12H12), Indane (ID 11, C9H10), Fluoranthene (ID 12, C16H10), Pyrene (ID 13, C16H10), Dibenzo thiophene (ID 14, C12H8S), ALH 83100, LEW 85311."

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The presence of both naphthalene and 2-Methyl naphthalene, as well as a significant number of shared compounds, in the Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, and LEW 85311 samples suggests that these meteorites have encountered similar organic precursors and/or alteration histories on their respective parent bodies. However, the differences in the presence/absence of other compounds indicate unique aspects to each meteorite's history as well.",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (ID 1, C10H8), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2, C11H10), Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Murchison, Jbilet Winselwan, LEW 85311."
        },
        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "The co-occurrence of C12H10 (Biphenyl) and C13H14 (Trimethyl naphthalene) in Orgueil and LEW 85311, while lacking in the other samples, points towards a unique formation or preservation environment on the parent body of LEW 85311 and Orgueil for these specific aromatic compounds.",
            "key_datapoints": "Biphenyl (ID 43, C12H10), Trimethyl naphthalene (ID 15, C13H14), Orgueil, LEW 85311."

            "key_datapoints": "1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene (ID 36, C14H14), 1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one (ID 44, C13H8O), Orgueil, Jbilet Winselwan."

        {
            "id": "H_five",
            "statement": "The presence of the identified internal contaminants (IDs 3, 6, 21, 22) across both biotic (soil) and abiotic (meteorite) samples suggests that these contaminants were introduced during the GCxGC-HRMS analysis process itself, rather than reflecting pre-existing contamination in the source materials.  The detection of phthalate compounds (IDs 9 and 24) primarily in soil samples also indicates these are likely due to terrestrial contamination from the sample handling or storage environment, rather than originating from the meteorites themselves.",
