    "Agent1_instructions": "Scientist 1, your focus is on the distribution and potential origins of smaller PAHs. Specifically, examine compounds ID #1 (Naphthalene), #2 (2-Methylnaphthalene), #7 (Toluene), #8 (1-Methylnaphthalene), #11 (Indane), #23 (Methylindan), #29 (Dichlorobenzene), #30 (Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)-), and #31 (o-Cymene). Considering the samples in which these compounds are found (both abiotic and biotic), formulate hypotheses regarding their formation pathways (abiotic vs. biotic) and their stability/preservation in different geological contexts. Given that these compounds are present in both meteorite and terrestrial samples, are they truly diagnostic of any specific origin? Pay close attention to the overlaps in sample presence and retention times. Can you formulate a hypothesis about the relative ease of formation and/or preservation of these compounds in different environments?",
    "Agent2_instructions": "Scientist 2, your task is to investigate the larger, more complex PAHs and related compounds. Focus on compounds ID #12 (Fluoranthene), #13 (Pyrene), #14 (Dibenzothiophene), #15 (Trimethyl Naphthalene), #32 (Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene with the formula C13H12), #33 (Acenaphthene), #35 (Polysubstituted alkylnaphthalene with the formula C16H18), #36 (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro phenanthrene), #37 (Dimethyl naphthalene), #42 (Phenanthrene or anthracene), #43 (Biphenyl), #44 (1H-Phenalen-1-one or 9H-Fluoren-9-one), and #45 (Dimethylpyrene). Analyze their distribution across the abiotic and biotic samples, focusing on the differences between the meteorite types and the terrestrial soil types. Formulate hypotheses about the potential sources and formation pathways of these compounds. Consider the impact of aqueous alteration and other geological processes on their presence or absence. Are there specific PAHs that seem to be more prevalent in certain sample types, and what might this indicate about their formation or degradation mechanisms?",
    "Agent3_instructions": "Scientist 3, your focus is on the unknown and tentatively identified compounds, with a particular emphasis on the potential for novel insights. Examine compounds ID #4 (Possible terpene or sesquiterpene), #5 (Polysubstituted alkylbenzene with formula C12H18), #10 (Unknown), #16 (Unknown), #17 (Possible terpene or sesquiterpene), #18 (Possible terpene or sesquiterpene), #19 (Unknown), #20 (Tetramethylindene), #25 (Dimethyl cyclohexane), #26 (Unknown), #27 (1,2,4-Trithiolane), #28 (Ergost-14-ene, (5?)-), #34 (Unknown), #38 (Unknown), #39 (Unknown), #40 (Unknown), and #41 (Unknown). Given the limited information, try to correlate their presence with specific sample types (e.g., Iceland soil, Rio Tinto soil, Antarctic meteorites). Formulate hypotheses about their potential chemical structures and origins, based on their m/z values and the types of samples in which they are found. Could these compounds be indicative of unique biological processes or specific geological conditions? Consider the possibility that some of these unknowns are related to known classes of compounds, even if the exact structure is not yet determined."
