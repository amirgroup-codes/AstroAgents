⚖️ Critic Feedback:
Here's a detailed, scientifically rigorous critique of each hypothesis, focusing on alignment with data, scientific evaluation, and integration with literature:

**Hypothesis H_final_one:**

*Statement:* Aqueous alteration on carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies leads to the degradation of larger PAHs into smaller, more volatile compounds, which are then lost to space or become localized in regions of low aqueous activity. The increase in smaller compounds results in lower m/z distributions in HR-L2MS analysis.

*   Alignment with the data: The data only partially supports this. While Ivuna and NWA 12328 do show a dominance of larger PAHs, the proposed loss of smaller compounds isn't directly evidenced. Chwichiya 002's dominance of C14H10 could be interpreted as support, but it could also be a primordial characteristic. A more nuanced hypothesis is needed.

*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible but oversimplified. Aqueous alteration is a complex process, and it's unlikely to result in a simple degradation of larger PAHs. It could also involve condensation, polymerization, or other reactions. Simply invoking "loss to space" lacks a concrete mechanism and doesn't explain the localization of smaller PAHs. The hypothesis also assumes that m/z distribution directly reflects the presence of PAHs. This assumption is wrong.

*   Integration with Literature: This contradicts the general understanding of aqueous alteration processes. Although a variety of alteration products are expected, the increase in smaller compounds is not a well known and well-supported aspect.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not particularly novel. The role of aqueous alteration in modifying organic matter is well known, but needs to be more specific to the data.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "Aqueous alteration on carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies promotes aromatic condensation, resulting in a relative increase in larger, more thermodynamically stable PAHs in highly altered meteorites. This process also leads to the formation of oxygenated PAHs."

**Hypothesis H_final_two:**

*Statement:* Hydrothermal activity, through Fischer-Tropsch type reactions, produces a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, but has a limited effect on the production of specific biomarkers (such as the long chains of carbon structures).

*   Alignment with the data: This alignment with the abundance of aliphatic hydrocarbons in Green River Shale and Lignite soil samples. The higher-abundance aliphatics, alongside the smaller PAH signals, suggest the specific type of hydrothermal activity.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible. FTT reactions are known to produce a range of hydrocarbons, but they don't typically lead to the formation of specific biomarkers with complex stereochemistry. The observation is consistent with the known products of FTT-like syntheses. The hypothesis is sound and correct.
*   Integration with Literature: This aligns well with the current understanding of FTT synthesis and its limitations in producing specific biomarkers. However, it fails to account for the role of mineral catalysts in directing reactions towards specific products.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel. The role of FTT to produce hydrocarbons is well-understood.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "Hydrothermal activity in organic-rich terrestrial environments can be a source of aliphatic hydrocarbons through Fischer-Tropsch type reactions that do not directly produce specific biomarkers. FTT products will be found in low-temperature, liquid-rich samples."

**Hypothesis H_final_three:**

*Statement:* The detection of oxygenated PAHs in the most aqueously altered meteorites indicates oxidative stress, which is consistent with the idea that oxidation is one of the most important factors in the degradation of organic matter in CCs.

*   Alignment with the data: The higher oxygenated PAHs peaks for Ivuna (CI1) and NWA 12328 (CM1) seem to be the only support. The general and vague hypothesis doesn't make a testable prediction and is therefore weak.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible but simplistic. Oxidative stress is a broad term, and the detection of oxygenated PAHs doesn't necessarily pinpoint the specific oxidation mechanisms involved. The hypothesis doesn't explain why some aqueously altered meteorites don't show the same high concentration of oxygenated PAHs.
*   Integration with Literature: It needs to be considered if the experimental data is compared with the relative energy of the reactions and the likelihood that the reactions will occur.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel and states the obvious.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The presence of oxygenated PAHs in meteorites is anti-correlated with the presence of other types of biomarkers. The exact pathway may depend on the original source of the organics, or on the specific conditions of the aqueous processing."

**Hypothesis H_final_four:**

*Statement:* The presence of a high proportion of compounds with positive mass defects in organic-rich soils indicates the presence of heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen and oxygen, suggesting that these compounds are different from the PAHs found in meteorites.

*   Alignment with the data: This statement is well aligned with the data. The high proportion of compounds with positive mass defects does suggest a greater presence of heteroatoms in the soil samples.
*   Scientific Evaluation: This is a strong hypothesis, but it does not provide a detailed explanation for the patterns.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis does not take into account some previous studies, and also the limitations of the experimental techniques.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The terrestrial soil samples are rich in biological material, and therefore, contain a high proportion of compounds with positive mass defects, reflecting the presence of a larger number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the biological component of the soil samples."

**Hypothesis H_final_five:**

*Statement:* In CM2 chondrites, the degree of aqueous alteration correlates with the ratio of 1-Methyl naphthalene to 2-Methyl naphthalene, serving as a potential proxy for the extent of parent body processing. Specifically, a lower 1-Methyl naphthalene to 2-Methyl naphthalene ratio indicates higher degree of aqueous alteration.

*   Alignment with the data: The data in the table is not well aligned with the hypothesis.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is not particularly strong, and it can be discarded. The hypothesis is not well supported because the data does not contain any information about 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis contradicts the literature review.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: This hypothesis needs to be discarded due to the lack of supporting information.

**Hypothesis H_final_six:**

*Statement:* The presence of Indane (C9H10) in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 suggests a unique formation pathway or source specific to the Antarctic CM chondrites that is distinct from the formation environment of Orgueil and other CM chondrites.

*   Alignment with the data: It is not possible to determine the alignment with the data because nothing indicates the presence of Indane in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311.
*   Scientific Evaluation: This is a weak hypothesis because the data does not contain any information about Indane in the specified meteorites.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis contradicts the literature review.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: This hypothesis needs to be discarded due to the lack of supporting information.

**Hypothesis H_final_seven:**

*Statement:* The co-occurrence of Fluoranthene (C16H10) and Pyrene (C16H10) with Dibenzo thiophene (C12H8S) in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311 points towards a shared origin or formation environment where sulfurization processes are active, leading to the incorporation of sulfur into aromatic compounds.

*   Alignment with the data: The co-occurrence of Fluoranthene, Pyrene and Dibenzo thiophene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311 is confirmed by the data.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible but overly general. The co-occurrence of these compounds could be due to multiple factors, not just sulfurization. Also, it does not provide a specific mechanism for the sulfurization process.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis needs to take into account previous studies about PAH formation in meteorites.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "In Orgueil, ALH 83100, and LEW 85311, fluoranthene, pyrene, and dibenzothiophene are co-inherited from the interstellar medium, and dibenzothiophene may have been formed due to mild parent body alteration."

**Hypothesis H_final_eight:**

*Statement:* The presence of alkylated naphthalenes in both the biotic Green River Shale soil and the abiotic carbonaceous chondrites indicates that alkylation processes are not unique to biotic environments and may be influenced by abiotic factors.

*   Alignment with the data: This statement is well aligned with the data. It is confirmed that alkylated naphthalenes are present in both the biotic and abiotic samples.
*   Scientific Evaluation: This is a strong hypothesis, but it does not provide a detailed explanation for the patterns.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis does not take into account some previous studies, and also the limitations of the experimental techniques.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The detection of alkylated naphthalenes in both Green River Shale soil and carbonaceous chondrites suggests that abiotic alkylation, driven by low-temperature hydrothermal processes, can occur in extraterrestrial environments, but also in terrestrial sediments."

**Hypothesis H_final_nine:**

*Statement:* The presence of toluene (C7H8) and indane (C9H10) in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311) suggests a pre-solar origin where these simple aromatics formed in the interstellar medium and were incorporated into the meteorite parent body during its formation. The detection of these compounds, which are not as readily linked to biological processes, provides evidence of the survival of pre-solar material within these meteorites.

*   Alignment with the data: The co-occurrence of Toluene and Indane in ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 is confirmed by the data.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible, but it makes a strong assertion about the pre-solar origin of the compounds.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis does not take into account some previous studies, and also the limitations of the experimental techniques.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The presence of toluene and indane in Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311) points to a possible pre-solar origin. These simple aromatics have the potential of having formed in the interstellar medium and been incorporated into the meteorite parent body during its formation, with the detection also hinting at the survival of pre-solar material within these meteorites."

**Hypothesis H_final_ten:**

*Statement:* The co-occurrence of naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-methylnaphthalene (C11H10) in both Orgueil and the Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311), suggests a common formation pathway on the meteorite parent body, likely involving the low-temperature gas-phase reaction of phenyl radicals with vinylacetylene as described by Parker et al. This contrasts with the high-temperature combustion synthesis of PAHs in terrestrial environments.

*   Alignment with the data: The co-occurrence of Naphthalene and 2-Methyl naphthalene in Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 is confirmed by the data.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis does not take into account the role of different catalyst, and also the limitations of the experimental techniques.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The presence of naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene in Orgueil and the Antarctic meteorites (ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311) suggests a common formation pathway on the meteorite parent body, where the low-temperature gas-phase reaction of phenyl radicals with vinylacetylene may have been facilitated by mineral catalysts."

**Hypothesis H_final_eleven:**

*Statement:* The absence of fluoranthene (C16H10) and pyrene (C16H10) in the most aqueously altered meteorite, Aguas Zarcas, suggests that aqueous alteration processes on meteorite parent bodies may selectively degrade larger PAHs, leading to a relative enrichment of smaller PAHs. The presence of naphthalene in Aguas Zarcas, however, implies that it is more resistant to this degradation.

*   Alignment with the data: The hypothesis does not have good alignment with the data. The data indicates the presence of Fluoranthene (ID 12) and Pyrene (ID 13) in Aguas Zarcas.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is not particularly strong, and it can be discarded. The hypothesis is not well supported because the data contradicts the main premise.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis contradicts the literature review.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: This hypothesis needs to be discarded due to the lack of supporting information.

**Hypothesis H_final_twelve:**

*Statement:* The identification of distinct, low-confidence terpene or sesquiterpene-like compounds (ID 4, ID 17, ID 18) uniquely within the Iceland Soil, Atacama, and GSFC soil samples implies the presence of unique, low-abundance, and high-volatility biological compounds. The presence of these distinct compounds may be related to the unique local biosphere or microbial sources of organic compounds that are highly sensitive to degradation and diagenesis, making them hard to identify, which is why they're of low confidence.

*   Alignment with the data: The presence of ID 4, ID 17, and ID 18 in Iceland, Atacama, and GSFC soil is confirmed by the data.
*   Scientific Evaluation: The hypothesis is plausible but the lack of high confidence makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results.
*   Integration with Literature: The hypothesis does not take into account some previous studies, and also the limitations of the experimental techniques.

*   Novelty: This hypothesis is not novel.

*   Revised Hypothesis: "The detection of unique, low-abundance, low-confidence terpene or sesquiterpene-like compounds (ID 4, ID 17, ID 18) in Iceland Soil, Atacama, and GSFC soil samples, may reflect the presence of unique high-volatility biological compounds from the local biosphere or microbial sources. The low confidence in compound identification is consistent with their high sensitivity to degradation and diagenesis."
