            "id": "H_one",
            "statement": "Aqueous alteration on carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies may preferentially incorporate smaller, more soluble aromatic compounds like naphthalene, methylindan, and biphenyl into the aqueously altered regions, leading to their increased presence in aqueously altered meteorites like Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311.  This is evidenced by those meteorites showing the common presence of naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2),  1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8), Indane (ID 11) and Biphenyl (ID 43).",
            "key_datapoints": "Naphthalene (ID 1), 2-Methyl naphthalene (ID 2), 1-Methyl naphthalene (ID 8), Indane (ID 11), Biphenyl (ID 43), Orgueil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, LEW 85311"

        {
            "id": "H_two",
            "statement": "The presence of internal contaminants from the GC column (IDs 3, 6, 21, 22) in both biotic (terrestrial) and abiotic (meteorite) samples indicates a systemic issue. The presence of these contaminants in the Orgueil meteorite may be a consequence of the meteorite's well-known susceptibility to terrestrial contamination.",
            "key_datapoints": "Internal contaminant from the GC column (IDs 3, 6, 21, 22), Orgueil, Iceland Soil, Jarosite Soil, Antarctica Soil, Green River Shale soil, Lignite Soil, Utah soil Soil, GSFC soil Soil, ALH 83100, LON 94101, Aguas Zarcas, Jbilet Winselwan, EET 96029."

        {
            "id": "H_three",
            "statement": "Terrestrial soils (Iceland, Atacama, GSFC, Utah) show unique organic compounds, including possible terpenes or sesquiterpenes, due to their unique environments and biomes, but these compounds are not prevalent in the meteorite samples.",
            "key_datapoints": "Possible terpene or sesquiterpene (IDs 4, 17, 18), Polysubstituted alkylbenzene with formula C12H18 (ID 5), Tetrame thylindene (ID 20), Iceland Soil, Atacama, Utah soil Soil, GSFC soil Soil, Murchison Soil"

            "statement": "The presence of specific compounds such as Dichlorobenzene and a Bicyclo derivative in Murchison and Orgueil, which are absent from other samples, indicates the distinctiveness of the organic inventory of these two meteorites and the potential for unique formation pathways or source materials.",
            "key_datapoints": "Dichlorobenzene (ID 29), Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- (ID 30), Orgueil, Murchison"

            "key_datapoints": "1,2,4-Trithiolane (ID 27), Naphthalene, 2-Methyl naphthalene, 1-Methyl naphthalene, Indane, Fluoranthene, Pyrene, Aguas Zarcas, LEW 85311, Orgueil"
