            "statement": "The detection of specific aromatic compounds, such as fluoranthene, pyrene, and their alkylated derivatives, in both the Orgueil meteorite and the Antarctic meteorites ALH 83100, LON 94101, and LEW 85311 suggests a common extraterrestrial source and a preservation pathway independent of the terrestrial environment.  The co-occurrence of these compounds across diverse sample types points to robust formation mechanisms in the interstellar medium or within meteorite parent bodies.",

The absence of these compounds in the Orgueil meteorite, despite the presence of other common PAHs, indicates a divergent history or source.",

The presence of these compounds together does not provide a strong biosignature, and may instead point to a common precursor or formation pathway.",

These contaminants may mask or interfere with the detection of indigenous molecules, requiring careful background subtraction and analysis of procedural blanks to accurately assess the organic composition of samples.",

The absence of these compounds in other samples indicates that they are not ubiquitous and may be linked to specific environmental conditions.",

The absence of this compound in the other samples suggests that the environmental processes required for C12H18 are not universal.",

Since it is not present in the other samples, we can infer that it is either extraterrestrial in origin, or it is a terrestrial contaminant that only contaminates meteorites in specific conditions.",

It might be an indication that these triterpenes are more stable than others.",
